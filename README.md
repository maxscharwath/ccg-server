# ccg-server
A multiplayer collectible card game server

The goal of this project is to create a collectible card game largely inspired by *Hearthstone*.
The interesting points of this project are:
- How to implement all kinds of game mechanics.
- How to manage a game between 2 players in real time.
- Manage several parts simultaneously, manage the load.
- Implement player inventory management.
- How to earn cards and share them, maybe use a blockchain?

This project is a technical demonstration of my skills in developing a large project in a programming language that I really appreciate.
